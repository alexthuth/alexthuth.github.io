            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello, this is Seconds_0 page. I'm here desperately trying to teach myself to code by doing the worlds simplest tasks and doing it publicly.</p>
            <p> I've dabbled before, but this is no longer about learning in abstract. It's about doing projects and shipping them</p>
